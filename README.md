### Hi there! My name is Ethan Ho and I am a first year Computer Science major at UCI!

I'm interested in working on becoming a full stack developer by combining my classes and extracurricular activities.
I enjoy drinking boba tea or matcha, weight training and running (*though not necessarily at the same time*), and
I'm also a huge fan of dad jokes and wordplay.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `.py`, `.js` and `.ts`  
âš¡ Fun fact: I competed in the 2023 California International Marathon and finished in 3:36
