### Hi there! My name is Ethan Ho and I am a second year Computer Science major at UCI!

I'm interested in working on becoming a full stack developer by combining my classes and extracurricular activities.
I suffer from a mild caffeine addiction -- I prefer black, green, milk and matcha teas over coffee, but prefer black coffee over fruit teas.
I enjoy going to the gym and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
I'm also a huge fan of dad jokes and wordplay.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DSA and web dev.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `.java`, `.js`, `.py` and `.cpp`  
âš¡ Fun fact: I competed in the 2023 California International Marathon and finished in 3:36
