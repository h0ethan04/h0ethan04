### Hi there! My name is Ethan Ho and I am a third year Computer Science major at UCI!

I'm interested in working on becoming a well rounded developer by combining my classes and extracurricular activities.
I suffer from a mild caffeine addiction -- I currently make my own cold brew and enjoy matchas and macchiatos.
I enjoy going to the gym, biking, hiking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
I'm also a huge fan of dad jokes and wordplay.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on systems programming and web dev.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `.java`, `.js`, `.py`, `.c` and `.cpp`  
âš¡ Fun fact: I competed in the 2023 California International Marathon and finished in 3:36

My [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/h0ethan04/) and [**email**](mailto:hoea2@uci.edu) are available for quick contact.
